The “all-in” APR—the annual percentage rate a borrower actually pays after all costs are calculated—is often higher than the stated APR that appears in the loan contract (see Key Terms below). The average all-in APR is 90 percent for loans of less than $1,500 and 40 percent for loans at or above that amount, but the average stated APRs for such loans are 70 percent and 29 percent, respectively. This difference is driven by the sale of credit insurance and the financing of premiums; the lower, stated APR is the one required under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and excludes the cost of those ancillary products. The discrepancy makes it hard for consumers to evaluate the true cost of borrowing, compare prices, and stimulate price competition.
